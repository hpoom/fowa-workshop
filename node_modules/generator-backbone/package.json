  "readme": "# Backbone.js generator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-backbone.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-backbone)\n\nMaintainer: [Revath S Kumar](https://github.com/revathskumar)\n\nA Backbone generator for Yeoman that provides a functional boilerplate Backbone app out of the box. You also get access to a number of sub-generators which can be used to easily create individual models, views, collections and so on.\n\nOptional RequireJS (AMD) support has recently been added as a prompt when using the generator on new projects.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall: `npm install -g generator-backbone`\n\nMake a new directory and `cd` into it:\n```\nmkdir my-new-project && cd $_\n```\n\nRun `yo backbone`, optionally passing an app name:\n```\nyo backbone [app-name]\n```\n\n## Generators\n\nAvailable generators:\n\n- backbone:model\n- backbone:view\n- backbone:collection\n- backbone:router\n- backbone:all\n\n## Typical workflow\n\n```\nyo backbone # generates your application base and build workflow\nyo backbone:model blog\nyo backbone:collection blog\nyo backbone:router blog\nyo backbone:view blog\ngrunt server\n```\n\nAlso checkout this [NetTuts write-up](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/building-apps-with-the-yeoman-workflow/) for a guide to building Backbone.js apps using this generator.\n\n\n## Options\n\n* `--coffee`\n  \n  Generate scaffolds in CoffeeScript.\n  RequireJS is not supported with `--coffee` option for now.\n\n* `--skip-install`\n\n  Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after\n  scaffolding has finished.\n\n* `--test-framework=[framework]`\n\n  Defaults to `mocha`. Can be switched for\n  another supported testing framework like `jasmine`.\n\n* `--template-framework=[framework]`\n\n  Defaults to `lodash` templating with grunt-contrib-jst.\n  `handlebars` and `mustache` are also supported.\n  \n## A note regarding JST templates and strict mode\n\nIf you use strict mode in your app and JST templates the default grunt-jst implementation will cause your app to error out as the templates will be precompiled using a 'with' statement.\n\nThis can be addressed by changing the jst grunt task as follows:\n\n```\njst: {\n    compile: {\n        options:\n        {\n            templateSettings:\n            {\n                variable: 'data'\n            }\n        },\n        files: {\n            '.tmp/scripts/templates.js': ['<%= yeoman.app %>/scripts/templates/*.ejs']\n        }\n    }\n},\n```\nA result of this change is that your template variable definitions must also be updated from `<%= templateVariable %>` to `<%= data.templateVariable %>`. More information on this can be found in the [Underscore documentation](http://underscorejs.org/#template).\n\n## Contribute\n\nSee the [contributing docs](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/blob/master/contributing.md)\n\nWhen submitting an issue, please follow the [guidelines](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/blob/master/contributing.md#issue-submission). Especially important is to make sure Yeoman is up-to-date, and providing the command or commands that cause the issue.\n\nWhen submitting a bugfix, write a test that exposes the bug and fails before applying your fix. Submit the test alongside the fix.\n\nWhen submitting a new feature, add tests that cover the feature.\n\n\n## License\n\n[BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)\n",
