## Notes

Context switching between tools is as much of an issue as context switching between projects/work.

With compile libraries like Sass, Less, Coffeecript etc, use watch to live reload when files change.

The number one reason, according to HTTP Archive, that pages have slowed down is because of images.

Has yet to find a task that he can't script with Grunt. Has automated all his daily dev workflow with Grunt.
