## Notes

Context switching between tools is as much of an issue as context switching between projects/work.

With compile libraries like Sass, Less, Coffeecript etc, use watch to live reload when files change.

The number one reason, according to HTTP Archive, that pages have slowed down is because of images.

Has yet to find a task that he can't script with Grunt. Has automated all his daily dev workflow with Grunt.

Maybe get everybody in my team to code one grunt task in a future project lounge?

Create multi size images with srcN.

Image optermisation with _image-optim_. This grunt task is awsome, does all the image compression on the fly.

_concurrent_ will run undependent grunt tasks async. _newer_ will only run stuff that needs to run. Lots of people don't know about these two tools, so they are not being efficent with thier automation tools.
